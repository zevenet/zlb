# [ZEVENET Load Balancer](https://www.zevenet.com)
This is the repository of **ZEVENET Load Balancer** Community Edition (**Zen Load Balancer** CE next generation) and it'll guide you to install a development and testing instance of load balancer.

**ZEVENET becomes SKUDONET and RELIANOID**
ZEVENET project and brand is in the process of extinction in favor of the two new awesome projects called [SKUDONET](https://www.skudonet.com) and [RELIANOID](https://www.relianoid.com) which will ensure the continuity of the Zevenet products and services to all our customers and users. Both projects are legitimate to continue with the great work done all these years with Zevenet. Youâ€™re in good hands.

## Repository Contents
In this repository you'll find the source code usually placed into the folder `/usr/local/zevenet/` with the following structure:
- **app/**: Applications, binaries and libraries that ZEVENET Load Balancer requires.
- **bin/**: Additional application binaries directory. 
- **backups/**: Default folder where the configuration backups will be placed.
- **config/**: Default folder where the load balancing services, health checks and network configuration files will be placed.
- **etc/**: Some system files to configure ZEVENET Load Balancer services.
- **lib/**: Folder where ZEVENET funcionality library is located.
- **share/**: Folder for templates and other data.
- **www/**: Backend API source files of ZEVENET Load Balancer.
- *other*: License and this readme information.
And `/usr/share/perl5/Zevent` with the entire ZEVENET backend core.

## ZEVENET Load Balancer Installation

Currently, there is only available package for Debian Buster, the installation is not supported out of this operating system.

There are two options to deploy a ZEVENET load balancer: The first is deploying the ZEVENET CE ISO, and the other is deploying a Debian Buster image and installing ZEVENET with its dependencies.

### ISO

ZEVENET CE ISO is a Debian Buster template with ZEVENET already installed. It can be got from the following link, clicking on the "Download ISO image" button.

https://www.zevenet.com/products/community/


### Installation on Debian Buster

If you prefer install ZEVENET yourself, you should get a Debian ISO installable from [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/distrib/). This installation process has been only tested with the 64 bits version.

Please, take into account these **requirements** before installing the load balancer:

1. You'll need at least 1,5 GB of storage.

2. Install a fresh and basic Debian Buster (64 bits) system with *openssh* and the basic system tools package recommended during the distribution installation.

3. Configure the load balancer with a static IP address. ZEVENET Load Balancer doesn't support DHCP yet.

4. Configure the *apt* repositories in order to be able to install some dependencies.


This git repository only contains the source code, the installable packages based in this code are updated in our Zevenet APT repos, you can use them configuring your Debian Buster system as follows: 

```
root@zevenetlb#> echo "deb http://repo.zevenet.com/ce/v5 buster main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zevenet.list
root@zevenetlb#> wget -O - http://repo.zevenet.com/zevenet.com.gpg.key | apt-key add -
```
Now, update the local APT database
```
root@zevenetlb#> apt-get update
```
And finally, install the ZEVENET CE
```
root@zevenetlb#> apt-get install zevenet
```

## Updates

Please use the ZEVENET APT repo in order to check if updates are available.


## How to Contribute
You can contribute with the evolution of the ZEVENET Load Balancer in a wide variety of ways:

- **Creating content**: Documentation in the [GitHub project wiki](https://github.com/zevenet/zlb/wiki), doc translations, documenting source code, etc.
- **Help** to other users through the mailing lists.
- **Reporting** and **Resolving Bugs** from the [GitHub project Issues](https://github.com/zevenet/zlb/issues).
- **Development** of new features.

### Reporting Bugs

1. Please use the GitHub project Issues to report any issue or bug with the software.
2. Try to describe the problem and a way to reproduce it.
3. To facilitate troubleshooting from our side, attach supportsave, tcpdump and .har files. Also, attach any screenshot if necessary.
4. In case these files contain sensible information that the user does not want to share in GitHub, please send an email to ce-support@zevenet.com with the same subject as the issue title published in GitHub and the relevant files attached.

### Generating Support Files

**First of all, enable debugging in the farms affected:**

###### HTTP/S:
  ```
  cd /usr/local/zevenet/config
  sed -i '/^LogLevel/c\LogLevel 7' FARMNAME_proxy.cfg` (replace FARMNAME with the name of the farm in question) 
  ```
  Restart the farm
  
###### L4XNAT:
  ```
  cd /usr/local/zevenet/config
  sed -i '/^\$nftlb_debug/c\$nftlb_debug="9"' global.conf
  /etc/init.d/zevenet stop
  /etc/init.d/zevenet start
  ```

If the debug log are enabled, more information can be logged and it will help us to analyze the problem.

**Then, proceed to collect the information that we need to start troubleshooting:**

###### SUPPORTSAVE:
- Reproduce the error
- Get the supportsave file via WebGUI or via commandline
  - Via WebGui:
    - Go to System-> Supportsave
    - Click on "I understand ..."
    - Click on "Generate report" and a file will be downloaded locally.
   - Via Commandline:

    ```
    /usr/local/zevenet/bin/supportsave (a file will be saved in /tmp directory)
    ```

###### .HAR FILE:
- Press F12 in the browser
- Reproduce the error
- Export .har file

###### TCPDUMP FILE:
```
tcpdump -s 65535 -w <file>` (replace <file> with the filename where you want to capture the dump)
```
- Reproduce the error
- Control+C to stop capturing

###### SCREENSHOTS:
- Do some screenshots if the issue is experienced in the WebGUI
